A Mountain Climber who is standing on a mountain top needs to return safely to the basecamp. The Mountain Climber has a fixed distance he can cover during the day, he must stay over in an inn in order to make it back to the basecamp from the mountain top.

The program recieves a graph of the available routes on the mountain, and returns the inns the traveller can stay in in order to return to the basecamp.
